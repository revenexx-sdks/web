     * The filters are what make this list usable: `?code=` turns a scope slug another app stored into the channel row that owns it, `?is_default=true` finds the fallback channel without resolving a context, and `?unassigned_visibility=assigned_only` finds the channels that closed their assortment. Every filter is an exact-column equality — there is no contains, prefix or range form — and the honoured set is exactly this entity's 11 columns, because the generic list mount matches any query key that names one. Each of them is declared as a query parameter with the column's own CHECK behind it, so the 11 that work are the 11 the document offers rather than a list a caller has to keep somewhere. An unknown column is dropped rather than refused, so `?stauts=active` returns the unfiltered page; `filter` echoes what was understood, which is the only way to catch that. Paging is `limit`/`offset` over whatever survived the filters, and `?order=` sorts by one column with an optional `.asc`/`.desc`; ask for no order and the page comes back in insertion order. `order` is the one input here that is refused rather than ignored — a malformed value, or one naming a column this entity does not have, is a 400 where the same mistake in a filter key passes silently.
     *
     * @param {string} params.id - Filter to one channel by row id. The same row GET /channels/{id} answers, but inside the list envelope — so a caller gets `page` and the `filter` echo with it, and a uuid that names no row is a 200 with an empty page rather than a 404.
     * @param {string} params.code - Filter to one channel by its scope slug. Unique per tenant, so this selects at most one row — the way to turn a scope slug held by another app into the channel it names.
     * @param {string} params.name - Filter by display name. Whole-string, case-sensitive equality — there is no contains or prefix form; `?code=` is the stable handle and this is the human one.
     * @param {string} params.labels - Filter by the localized-names map, as an exact jsonb document: the value must be a whole JSON object and it must match the stored map completely, not merely overlap it. Key order and whitespace do not matter (the column is jsonb, which normalizes both); a missing or extra language tag does. A value that is not valid JSON is refused with 400 `invalid_value` — this is the one filter here that can be malformed rather than merely unmatched.
     * @param {string} params.type - Filter to one channel type, by code. One of the codes the tenant keeps under GET /channels/types — served with labels as the 'channels.types' vocabulary. Deliberately NOT an enum: the set is the tenant's own rows, not a CHECK constraint this repo could quote. A fresh install starts with storefront, punchout, marketplace, api, pos, which is why 'storefront' is the example here, but a merchant may rename or retire any of them and add their own (a feed or a print channel), so read the list rather than assuming it.
     * @param {ChannelStatus} params.status - Filter by lifecycle status. A value outside the CHECK constraint is not an error — it simply matches nothing and comes back as a 200 with an empty page.
     * @param {ChannelUnassignedVisibility} params.unassignedVisibility - Filter by the per-channel visibility override — how a punchout channel that closed its assortment is found. `?unassigned_visibility=assigned_only` lists exactly the channels that hide unassigned rows; `inherit` lists the ones still taking the tenant's answer.
     * @param {boolean} params.isDefault - Filter to the default channel — the one a request naming no channel falls back to. More than one row coming back is a misconfiguration; /channels/context reports the same condition as default_ambiguous.
     * @param {number} params.position - Filter by exact sort position. An equality, not a range: there is no `position_gte`.
     * @param {string} params.createdAt - Filter by exact insert instant — equality to the microsecond, not a range, so this is for reproducing a known row rather than for windowing. Use `?order=created_at.desc` to sort by it.
     * @param {string} params.updatedAt - Filter by exact last-write instant. Equality to the microsecond, like `created_at`.
     * @param {number} params.limit - Page size (default 50, max 200).
     * @param {number} params.offset - Row offset for pagination (default 0).
     * @param {string} params.order - Sort by one column: 'column' | 'column.asc' | 'column.desc'. A bare column sorts ascending. Anything else — or a column this entity does not have — is refused with 400.
     * @throws {RevenexxException}

     * Two fields are yours and everything else has an answer already: `code` and `name` are the only columns the database will not fill in, and the rest arrive from their defaults — `status` active, `unassigned_visibility` inherit, `is_default` false, `position` 0. `type` is the exception the app makes for itself: omitted, it becomes the type the tenant FLAGGED as their default rather than the column default, so a merchant who retired the seeded `storefront` does not get channels carrying a type they no longer keep. `code` is the load-bearing one. It is the scope slug Baseline matches every channel assignment on, which is why it is held to Baseline's own shape here rather than to the column's `length > 0`, and why it is unique per tenant — a second channel claiming a code another already holds is a 409 off the `(tenant_id, code)` index. Treat it as permanent: the API will let you change it later and nothing follows it (see PUT /channels/{id}). Creating a channel assigns nothing to it. Products, categories and everything else scopeable stay exactly as visible as they were — until rows are assigned, what this channel shows is whatever `unassigned_channel_visibility` says, which on the shipped default is the entire catalogue. And a code is only free in THIS app: assignments made against a code that a since-deleted channel used are still in Baseline, so re-using the code adopts them.
     *
     * @param {string} params.code - Stable channel code, unique per tenant (e.g. shop, punchout-acme). It is the scope slug Baseline matches channel assignments on, so it is held to Baseline's own shape: lowercase a-z/0-9 first, then a-z/0-9/_/-, up to 63 characters. Anything else is refused — a code that cannot be a scope slug leaves the channel unable to filter.
     * @param {string} params.name - Display name.
     * @param {boolean} params.isDefault - Mark as the default channel (default false). At most one channel carries it — setting it demotes the previous holder.
     * @param {object} params.labels - Localized display names. A locale map keyed by language tag: {"en": …, "de": …}. Read the requested tag and fall back to the plain column beside it.
     * @param {number} params.position - Sort position (default 0).
     * @param {ChannelStatus} params.status - Lifecycle status (default 'active'). Whether the channel is in service. What 'inactive' DOES is the tenant's inactive_channel_behavior setting: on 'serve' it is a label and the channel still resolves, on 'block' /channels/context answers resolved:false with reason 'channel_inactive'. Served as the 'channels.statuses' vocabulary.
     * @param {string} params.type - Which channel type this is. One of the codes the tenant keeps under GET /channels/types — served with labels as the 'channels.types' vocabulary. Deliberately NOT an enum: the set is the tenant's own rows, not a CHECK constraint this repo could quote. A fresh install starts with storefront, punchout, marketplace, api, pos, which is why 'storefront' is the example here, but a merchant may rename or retire any of them and add their own (a feed or a print channel), so read the list rather than assuming it. Omitted on create it falls back to the type the tenant flagged as their default, never to a hardcoded value; a code the tenant does not keep is a 400 that names the ones they do.
     * @param {ChannelUnassignedVisibility} params.unassignedVisibility - Default 'inherit'. What it means, IN THIS CHANNEL, that a row carries no channel assignment at all — the per-channel override of the tenant-wide unassigned_channel_visibility setting. 'inherit' (the default) takes the tenant's answer and changes nothing. 'all' shows unassigned rows: everything is on sale unless somebody carved it out, which is what an open storefront wants and what Baseline's is_visible() does today. 'assigned_only' hides them until they are explicitly assigned — the negotiated assortment a punchout contract describes, and the one answer the generated _scoped view has no way to express, which is why POST /channels/visibility exists to apply it. Rows that DO carry assignments are unaffected either way. Served with its labels as the 'channels.unassigned-visibility' vocabulary.

    /**
     * The repair call. A tenant installed before `channel_types` existed, or one that deleted its way into a state where nothing works, gets the shipped starting point back — the 5 seeded types first, because the seeded channel carries one of them, then the `shop` channel. Most tenants never call it: the platform invokes the same routine itself on `app.installed`, so a fresh install already has its 5 types and its shop channel before anyone asks, and this route exists for the tenant whose install predates them or who has since removed them. Calling it on a settled tenant is safe and cheap for the same reason it is safe to fire on every install: it is idempotent, keyed on the code, so a second call writes nothing. Everything a merchant added themselves is left alone, and a row that already exists is reported under `existing` rather than rewritten — the values you edited on a seeded type survive this call. It RESTORES THE WHOLE SEED SET, including a seeded type the merchant deliberately deleted. Idempotency here is keyed on the code and nothing else, and there is nowhere to remember a retirement: retirement is not a state this app can represent. Retiring a type IS deleting the row; `channel_types` has no retired flag and these tables carry no foreign keys, so nothing anywhere distinguishes a code a merchant removed on purpose from one they never had. Honouring the retirement would mean inventing a tombstone rather than reading one. Given that, restoring all 5 is the better half of the trade: this is the call a tenant makes when something is missing, and a repair that silently skips part of what it repairs, with no way to ask for the rest, is worse than one that says plainly what it puts back. It is also never a surprise. The only automatic seeding elsewhere in the app fires when the type table is completely EMPTY, which cannot happen once installed because the last remaining type cannot be deleted — so a retired type comes back exactly when somebody calls this route or the app is installed again, and never as a side effect of an unrelated read. Deleting it a second time costs one DELETE, and is refused only if a channel has since started carrying it. What it does not do: it creates no assignments, it does not repair a channel whose own code you deleted (only `shop` comes back), and it does not restore the seeded VALUES of a type that still exists — a renamed `storefront` stays renamed.

     * @param {number} params.position - Sort position (default 0).
     * @param {ChannelStatus} params.status - Lifecycle status (default 'active'). Whether the channel is in service. What 'inactive' DOES is the tenant's inactive_channel_behavior setting: on 'serve' it is a label and the channel still resolves, on 'block' /channels/context answers resolved:false with reason 'channel_inactive'.
